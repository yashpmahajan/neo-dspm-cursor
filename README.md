git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

That’s a great idea! Splitting your project into a `backend` and a `UI` (frontend) folder is a common and effective way to organize a full-stack application. Here’s how this structure helps:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Backend (API, business logic, database) and UI (React app) are clearly separated.
- **Scalability:** Each part can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
- **Team Collaboration:** Frontend and backend teams can work in parallel with minimal conflicts.

### Recommended Structure

```
/neo-dspm-hub/         # (or your project root)
  /backend/            # For all backend code (Node.js, Express, Python, etc.)
  /UI/                 # For all frontend code (your current React app)
```

### Next Steps

1. **Move your current React app** (everything in `neo-dspm-hub/`) into a new `UI` folder.
2. **Create a new `backend` folder** for your backend code (can be empty for now, or initialized with your preferred backend framework).

Would you like me to:
- Move all your current frontend code into a `UI` folder?
- Create an empty `backend` folder for you?
- Update any paths or scripts as needed?

Let me know if you want to proceed with these changes, and I’ll handle the file moves and setup!
